# WS5: Docs and Examples Plan

## Deliverables

- `docs/development/` internals docs (architecture, threading, backends, invariants).
- `docs/usage/` user docs (quickstart, runtime setup, APIs, recipes).
- `example/` programs (echo server/client, timeout usage, backend toggle).

## Tasks

1. Write architecture and backend comparison documentation.
2. Write usage docs with build/run snippets.
3. Implement and wire examples into CMake.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Docs are complete enough for contributor and user onboarding.
- Examples compile and run from documented commands.
