# WS6: Review Loop Plan

## Deliverables

- Independent reviewer passes with actionable findings.
- Iterative fixes and reruns until one clean review round.

## Tasks

1. Spawn reviewer agents with scoped responsibilities:
   - code correctness and architecture
   - tests and coverage sufficiency
   - docs/API clarity
2. Apply fixes, rerun checks, and record outcomes.
3. Close with final acceptance report.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Latest reviewer round reports no blocking issues.
- Test and coverage proof revalidated after final fixes.
